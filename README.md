## Getting Started

### Currently, this application will not function without [![Maxy's GameBuilder]](https://github.com/mramazzini/GameBuilder). 

Currentely, you must clone this repository, as well as Maxy's GameBuilder, into the same directory. 

-Shared Folder
--Maxy's_Game_Engine_Repo_here
--Maxy's_Game_Builder_Repo_here

You must install the [![SDL2 library]](https://www.libsdl.org/)  as well as the [![SDL@_image]](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2_image/FrontPage) library. 

After that, you will find all neccessary .cpp and .h files within the src directory. Compile with your C++ Compiler into the build folder. Make sure the SDL2 and SDL_image .dll files are within the build directory whenver you attempt to launch the .exe file.
